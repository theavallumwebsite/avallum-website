While looking for some leads, the captain decided to post flyers looking for adventurers; thus connecting him with a certain green elfman who may have some information to share.

He cares deeply for his fellow genmates and his crew, which reflects in everything that he puts out in the universe. Be warned about giving him TV privileges though!

Being the most gifted, Cass was trusted with a magical crystal and the knowledge of ‚ÄúAvallum‚Äù‚Äí a magical place that will grant you a wish. Guided by his Elders, Cassian is instructed to leave his village to seek the help of humans in order to reach this ‚ÄúAvallum‚Äù.

While they may cause him to be disgruntled, he never turns his back on them when they need help in game or in life. His loyalty and benevolence is passed to his fans as well. He takes good care of the community he is curating; always showing appreciation and enthusiasm. His elegance doesn‚Äôt prevent the occasional sussy noise though, so if you happen to be listening to him outloud, it might be wise to not listen in public or at a family dinner. ",

Tragedy struck his home village, leaving nothing but despair and ash in its wake. After losing his friend and family, Lucien went on his journey alone with a new wish in mind.

This side shows more when he banters in collabs, or with his dear Lunarists. His melodious tone isn‚Äôt just apparent in his speaking voice though. When Lucien sings, you can‚Äôt help but become mesmerized by his talent. Another thing to note is that while he may be forgetful, he always remembers what his fans and genmates do for him; always ensuring to show his appreciation for every little thing. He is also a man of wisdom. Always giving kind words and motivation to anyone who might need it. He truly leaves a lasting impression on anyone who is lucky enough to cross his path.",

      "lore": "Why, hello there.~ Meet the remarkable Zander Netherbrand! This incubus felt trapped in a life of riches and status, bestowed on his demonic family due to them owning a magical crystal. Said crystal was sought after by countless demons, and once caused a war for a multitude of years. Deciding that he wanted freedom from his stifling family, not to mention the power that comes with it, Zander steals the crystal and flees. Along his journey of freedom, he manages to meet other crystal holders and with their shared knowledge, they search for ‚ÄúAvallum‚Äù. According to Zanny, it‚Äôs a place where realities touch and where a wish will be granted. What does he want with that wish? Well, we‚Äôll just have to stick around to find out.",
      "personality": "This charming, purple incubus, and host of Club Netherbrand, is more than meets the eye! While he is indeed quite beautiful, Zander is wise beyond his years. Although being unapologetically honest when spreading that wisdom may cause Mane-san some heart attacks, that honesty is part of what makes Netherlings connect with him easier. While that may make him seem intimidating as he won‚Äôt hesitate to call things out as he sees it, Zanny is so sweet you get cavities just from listening to him. He is also an insanely smooth talker. This side of Zander really shows in his ASMRs, Zatsudans and his voice packs. If you ever find yourself listening to those, just be warned that the chances of you combusting on the spot are quite high‚Ä¶",

As a lab experiment in a torturous lab being mistreated everyday, Rosco decided that enough was enough. He fought back against the evil beings holding him there‚Äîmanaging to steal a unique heart-shaped crystal along the way. Just after escaping, he is somehow magically transported into an arcade, where he inserts the crystal into one of the games. Weirdly enough, this caused him to teleport once more, only this time he isn‚Äôt alone when he gets there. He then finds himself standing among a strange group of individuals, all with crystals of their own. They tell him they‚Äôre looking for a place called ‚ÄúAvallum‚Äù in order to obtain a special wish. Deciding that this wish would be worth his while, Rosco joins the rag-tag group consisting of an elf, a vampire, an incubus and a human. Thus his journey of seeking ‚ÄúAvallum‚Äù begins.",
      "personality": "Rosco Graves is a multi-talented individual. Anything that he sets his mind to, can be achieved with flying colors. Whether it be singing, rapping, voice packs or gaming, this artistic genius excels at it all. While he is extremely hardworking and energetic, he still has a calm and laid-back side to him as well. Contradictive, I know‚Ä¶ It really just depends on the situation. If you‚Äôre a Roscal, don‚Äôt try to fight him without expecting some kind of push back; but also know that this zombie is one of the kindest guys around. You can also see his more energetic and playful side when he interacts with his fellow genmates. But beware of wearing headphones while watching him, as he can be quite loud‚Ä¶",
